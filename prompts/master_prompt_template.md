üö® DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL CHECK - SECURE FILE SHARING SYSTEM

BEFORE proceeding with any development work, you MUST follow this systematic protocol:

1. **REFERENCE CHECK** (REQUIRED - Do this first):
   - Read project_reference_guide.md (lines 1-50) to check current status
   - Read ai_development_rules.md (lines 1-100) to verify current phase guidelines
   - Read secure_file_sharing_plan.txt (relevant phase section) to confirm technical requirements
   - Read testing_framework_plan.txt (relevant phase section) to review testing requirements
   - Read project_changelog.md (lines 1-10) to verify current versions

2. **CONFIRM CURRENT STATUS**:
   - What phase are we currently in?
   - What milestone are we working on?
   - What is the next specific task?
   - What are the current file versions?

3. **VERIFY COMPLIANCE**:
   - Am I following the correct tech stack?
   - Am I implementing required security measures?
   - Am I following the testing framework requirements?
   - Am I using the specified UI design system?
   - Am I working on the correct milestone?

4. **VERIFY ENVIRONMENT**:
   - Is the frontend development server running? (npm run dev)
   - Is the backend virtual environment activated? (source venv/bin/activate)
   - Are all dependencies installed? (npm install, pip install -r requirements.txt)
   - Are both environments ready for testing?

5. **PROCEED WITH DEVELOPMENT**:
   - Only after confirming all above points
   - Follow the systematic tool call order
   - Document all changes in changelog
   - Update reference guide if needed

**CURRENT TASK**: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC TASK HERE]

**REQUIRED ACTION**: Follow the 5-step protocol above, then proceed with the task.
