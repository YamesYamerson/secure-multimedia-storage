# Secure File Sharing System for Private Family Use

## 1. Project Overview
Create a lightweight, ultra-secure, web-based file sharing system to allow family members to upload, download, and manage pictures, documents, and videos. All files will include metadata tracking (title, description, timestamps, user actions) and a search/sort interface. The system should prioritize security, privacy, usability, and maintainability.

## 2. Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Framework**: Vanilla JS with Tailwind CSS (lightweight approach)
- **Bundler**: Vite (for fast builds and local dev)
- **Optional**: Alpine.js for reactive interactions without React

### Backend:
- **API Interface**: AWS API Gateway
- **Serverless Functions**: AWS Lambda (written in Python)
- **AWS SDK**: Boto3 for S3 interaction and metadata operations
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito (lightweight, secure, managed)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (with fine-grained IAM policies and encryption)
- **Metadata Storage**: DynamoDB or S3 Object Metadata (for audit trails, search tags, etc.)

### Deployment:
- **Frontend Hosting**: Netlify or AWS Amplify
- **Backend/API**: AWS Lambda + API Gateway
- **Database**: DynamoDB (if needed)

---

## 3. Security Best Practices
- HTTPS enforced on all endpoints
- Use IAM roles with least-privilege access
- Use signed URLs for uploads/downloads
- Enable S3 versioning and server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- Set up AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for added protection
- Store metadata securely and encrypt sensitive fields
- Enable logging with CloudWatch and S3 access logs

---

## 4. Key Features & Requirements
### Functional Requirements:
- Upload files with metadata (title, description, tags, file type, user ID)
- Download/view files securely
- Search files by title, tags, file type, date, user
- View file history and who uploaded/modified it
- Modify metadata (for admins)
- Authentication and authorization (Cognito)
- Minimal UI with mobile responsiveness

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Ultra-lightweight frontend
- Fast performance and low latency
- Secure and private (not publicly indexable)
- Scalable with family usage in mind

## 8. Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks:
- **Lambda cold starts**: Implement provisioned concurrency for critical functions
- **S3 costs**: Set up billing alerts and implement lifecycle policies
- **Data loss**: Regular backups and cross-region replication
- **Security breaches**: Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Operational Risks:
- **User adoption**: Comprehensive training and intuitive UI design
- **Performance issues**: Monitoring and performance optimization
- **Maintenance overhead**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

---

## 9. Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics:
- File upload/download success rate > 99%
- API response time < 200ms
- System uptime > 99.9%
- Zero security incidents

### User Experience Metrics:
- User adoption rate within family
- Average session duration
- File organization usage
- Search functionality usage

---

## 10. Final Notes
- Keep dependencies minimal to reduce attack surface
- Ensure system is private by default (Cognito auth required for all access)
- Use environment variables for config (e.g., API endpoints, region)
- Consider backup plan for data redundancy (Cross-region S3 replication)
- Regular security reviews and updates
- Family feedback integration for continuous improvement

---

This comprehensive system will provide a long-term, secure, and private solution for family file sharing with ownership tracking, metadata-rich searchability, and robust administrative tools.
